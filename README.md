**Northcoders News API**

Overview

We will be building an API for the purpose of accessing application data programmatically. The intention here is to mimic the building of a real world backend service which should provide this information to the front end architecture. This project will go through test driven development, with error handling thoroughly considered. 


""Set Up**

To set up, create a local repository using following git clone - https://github.com/phillee20/NC-News-backend-Project.git

Then create 2 new files on the root directory, as below

.env.test
.env.development

Each file should have the respective content below

PGDATABASE=nc_news_test
PGDATABASE=nc_news

Next, run npm install and it will install a package and dependencies. Running npm install without arguments installs modules defined in the dependencies section of the package.json file.
